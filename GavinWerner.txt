Hi! My name is Gavin Werner. I'm originally from Florida but I currently live in
 Colorado. I went to school in Hawaii but my degree wasn't in computer science.
I actually studied hospitality management so this is a big leap for me! One thin
g that I love doing in my free time is playing guitar and music production.
